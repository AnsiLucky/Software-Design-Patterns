# Abstract Factory #

Abstract Factory decide which Factory it must create depending
on the config file or operating system.

In my example, I made realization of the CS2 round. When starting 
round, we must generate appropriate weapon for each side, because
terrorist side has different guns, than counter-terrorist side.

### I realize creation ### 
* Gun "Primary" category, in our case it is "Assault Rifle"
* Gun "Secondary category", in our case it is "Pistol'
* Equipment (bomb or defuse kit)
